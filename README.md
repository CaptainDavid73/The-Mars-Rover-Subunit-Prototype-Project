This is the GitHub repository for all of the code, and fusion 360 files, for the MSPP. If you are curious what the MSPP entails, read the README, and find out all about it!

**The Mars Rover Subunit Prototype Project**

**Created and designed by David Koopmans**

_Plan and formalization:_

_General formalization and means behind the MSPP:_

This project will base its function around a few principles, which are the following.

Firstly, the MSPP is a prototype for a subunit to the next Mars Rover mission. What I mean with subunit is that it is a smaller space vehicle, stored inside the main Mars Rover, capable of driving and navigating on the surface of Mars, or potentially other planets, if so desired. The function of the MSPP is to be a complimentary part to the Mars Rover. When, for example, the Mars Rover is to survey a particular area on Mars, the MSPP can be deployed in order to speed up sensor readings in that area. This can be very beneficial to the further colonization of Mars, as the MSPP can make quick surveys of the ground surface, to determine ground temperature, soil dampness, etc. This, all while the main Mars Rover is taking more detailed readings with spectrometry, or likewise. One thing to note is that the MSPPâ€™s systems will be completely modular, and removable if so desired. This is due to both my need for an excellent and adaptable design, but also for ease of use when in the designing and assembling process of the MSPP.

Secondly, the MSPP serves as a discussion piece, more than a practical piece. As acquiring very accurate sensors and such can become very expensive, and out of scope for this project. Essentially, due to financial reasons, the MSPP will serve as a discussion piece. That said, the engineering principles will challenge the would-be real technology that the MSPP, one day could have, if it is applied in a more financially positive environment.

Lastly, the MSPP is a project, for testing my own abilities as an upcoming engineer. This entails both electrical engineering capabilities, and mechanical engineering capabilities.
